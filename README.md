# flask-rest-api-sandbox
Sandbox to play around with flask restful api stuff.

# To Run:

* Create a virtual environment by typing the command `virtualenv venv`.

* To activate your virtual environment on Windows, type `venv\Scripts\activate`. On Unix-based machines, type `source venv/bin/activate`. You should see `(venv)` preceding your bash prompt.

* Once activated, type `pip install --upgrade pip` to ensure you have the latest `pip` install.

* Once you do, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies for this project.

* From there, you should simply be able to run the Python project by typing `python sandbox` from inside the `flask-rest-api-sandbox` directory.

* Navigate to the appropriate web URL (usually http://localhost:5000) and you should be presented with a login page.
